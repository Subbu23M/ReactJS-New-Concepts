React Life Cycle Methods:
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

1)Mounting:Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
a)constructor()
    The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.
    The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component).

b)render()
    The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.

c)getDervivedStateFromProps()
    The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
    It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

d)componentDidMount()
    The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
    This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM. 

2)Updating : A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
a)getDervivedStateFromProps()
    The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
    It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

b)render()
    The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.

c)shouldComponentUpdate
    In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
    The default value is true.

d)getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
    In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props and state before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update.
    If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the componentDidUpdate() method, otherwise you will get an error.

e)componentDidUpdate
    The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

3)Unmounting - The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.
a)ComponentWillUnmount : The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
